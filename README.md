# Chapter-How to get away with gradients

Biomolecular gradients are widely present in multiple biological processes. Historically they were reproduced in vitro by using micropipettes, Boyden and Zigmond chambers or hydrogels. Despite the great utility of these set-ups in the study of gradient-related problems such as chemotaxis, they face limitations when trying to translate more complex in vivo-like scenarios to in vitro systems. In the last 20 years, the advances in manufacturing of micromechanical systems (MEMS) had opened the possibility of applying this technology to biology (BioMEMS). In particular, microfluidics has proven extremely efficient in setting-up biomolecular gradients which are stable, controllable, reproducible and at length scales that are relevant to cells. In this chapter, we give an overview of different methods to generate molecular gradients using microfluidics, then we discuss the different steps of the pipeline to fabricate a gradient-generator microfluidic device, and at the end we show an application example of the fabrication of a microfluidic device that can be used to generate a surface-bound biomolecular gradient.

## Application example 
The microfluidic channels will be 500 µm in width and 200 µm in height. Since these dimensions are faithfully achieved by 3D printing, we will use this method to generate the mold. The mechanical bonding will be performed by screwing two 3D printed holding pieces such as the one depicted in Figure 4c, which were designed with the dimensions of a multi-well plate to fit a microscope stage. Finally, the tubing and their connection to the chip and to the syringes will be performed with metallic cannulas and luer connectors, respectively.
